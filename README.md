docker-drupal
=============

This repo contains a recipe for making a [Docker](http://docker.io) container for Drupal, using Linux, Apache and MySQL. 
To build, make sure you have Docker [installed](http://www.docker.io/gettingstarted/), 

## Install docker:
```
curl get.docker.io | sudo sh -x
```

## Clone this repo somewhere, 
```
git clone https://github.com/ricardoamaro/docker-drupal.git
cd docker-drupal
```
and then build it:
```
sudo docker build -t <yourname>/drupal .
```

## And run the container, connecting port 80:
```
sudo docker run -d -t -p 80:80 <yourname>/drupal
```
That's it!
Visit http://localhost/ in your webrowser. 

Note: you cannot have port 80 already used or the container will not start.
In that case you can start by setting: `-p 8080:80`

build directly from github breaks at the moment:
```
sudo docker build -t <yourname>/drupal git://github.com/ricardoamaro/docker-drupal.git
```



### Credentials

* ROOT   MYSQL_PASSWORD will be on /mysql-root-pw.txt
* DRUPAL MYSQL PASSWORD will be on /drupal-db-pw.txt
* Drupal account-name=admin & account-pass=admin


## More docker awesomeness

This will create an ID that you can start/stop/commit changes:
```
# sudo docker ps
ID                  IMAGE                   COMMAND               CREATED             STATUS              PORTS
538114c20d36        <yourname>/drupal:latest   /bin/bash /start.sh   3 minutes ago       Up 6 seconds        80->80  
```

Start/Stop
```
sudo docker stop 538114c20d36
sudo docker start 538114c20d36
```

Commit the actual state to the image
```
sudo docker commit 538114c20d36 <yourname>/drupal
```

Starting again with the commited changes
```
sudo docker run -d -t -p 80:80 <yourname>/drupal /start.sh
```

Shipping the container image elsewhere 
```
sudo docker push  <yourname>/drupal
```

You can find more images using the [Docker Index][docker_index].

### Clean up
While i am developing i use this to rm all old instances
```
sudo docker ps -a | awk '{print $1}' | xargs -n1 -I {} docker rm {}
``` 

### Known Issues
* Upstart on Docker is broken due to [this issue][docker_upstart_issue], and that's one of the reasons the image is puppetized using vagrant.
* Warning: This is still in development and ports shouldn't be open to the outside world.
